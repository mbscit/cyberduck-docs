## Connection Profiles

[Connection profiles](profiles/index.md) (`.cyberduckprofile`) are plugins describing specific connection settings for a hosting provider to make it easier to setup a connection to your provider. A connection profile is installed and adds a provider option in the protocol selection drop down menu in the *Connection* and *Bookmark* panels. No need to enter the connection details manually other than credentials.

### Preferences → Profiles

Select connection protocols in _Preferences → Profiles_ to be installed in addition to the default protocols listed below. Either scroll through the list or use the search function to look for a specific profile. The connection profile will be installed after enabling the corresponding checkbox. To disable a connection profile simply uncheck the checkbox. The profile will be disabled after closing the application.
